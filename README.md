# personal-finance-tracker
This is my personal finance tracker :) <br>
I track my finance with a spreadsheet, and I am trying to turn it into a Python desktop app with a wxPython based GUI. <br>
This is very much work in progress, there are many more features I want to implement. <br>

Features
- read data from CSV files
- save data to CSV files
- edit data directly on GUI

v.0.0.9
- updated stocks list tab
- code cleanup
